This course will cover the following topics, although the precise list & order is subject to revision:

- View models and persisting state
- Testing & debugging
- Navigation UI & menus

Grading
----
Grades will be based on regular assignments (85%) and quizzes (15%). There is no final exam.

Weekly assignments will be posted on Canvas prior to class and are designed to exercise the skills and concepts covered that week. Assignments are due by the start of class on the following week, and late submissions may be subject to a 10% penalty.

Students will publish completed assignments to their github.com repository and submit the repository link in Canvas. Submissions should build successfully in Android Studio and run without errors on the Android device emulator or a mobile device.

You may discuss how to approach tasks with other students in the class, but your submission must be your own work. Code submissions that are substantially identical would be considered cheating and subject to a markdown penalty.

Quizzes will be administered via Canvas and must be completed during the specified time frame to receive credit.
