### FAQ

- Can I develop a mobile app for iOS and Android using one platform/language?
  - yes, but there are tradeoffs to using a single development platform to target both mobile OS's.
- Can I publish a mobile app outside of Apple / Google app stores?
  - iOS apps (for the most part) must be published through Apple's App store. Android apps can be published outside the Google Play store but this can limit discoverability & monitoring.
- Can I use a different IDE to develop an Android app?
  - Technically, yes. But Android Studio simplifies many tasks specific to Android development
- Should I develop an Android app with Java or Kotlin?
  - You can develop a native Android app with either language (or both). But Google now prefers Kotlin and some features, such as Jetpack Compose, require Kotlin.
